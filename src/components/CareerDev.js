        <p>To all those who are interested in applying for quant profiles in this upcoming placement season.

          <br></br>
          It is generally a concern among students about what and how to prepare for test of companies
          recruiting for quant researcher or strategist or trading profiles as most of these companies 
          have just recently started visiting the campus. So, some of the materials and resources that 
          I found very useful have been uploaded on the link above. The starred files and folders are the 
          ones you can begin with. They are fundamental resources out of which many problems have directly
          been asked. I have also added comments on some of the files regarding their difficulty or way to 
          approach. You are not at all expected to complete the entire material. This is mostly for
          keeping up your momentum from now onwards till tests and interviews, so that you donâ€™t get
           depleted of preparation material at any stage.
           <br></br>

           If you find any inadequacy/irrelevance in these materials, please ping Prithesh Kumbhare (Y15,EE)
           with the suggestions. Hope this helps!
